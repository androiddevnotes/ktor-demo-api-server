# Database Migrations with Flyway

## Introduction

Database migrations are a crucial part of managing and evolving your database schema over time. In our Ktor API project, implementing a robust migration strategy is essential for maintaining data integrity and facilitating smooth updates to our application.

Flyway is a popular database migration tool that can help us manage these changes effectively. It provides version control for your database schema, allowing you to track, manage, and apply database changes in a systematic way.
``
## Why Flyway is Useful for Our Ktor API

1. **Version Control for Database Schema**: Flyway allows us to track changes to our database schema over time, similar to how we use Git for our code.

2. **Consistency Across Environments**: It ensures that all environments (development, staging, production) have the same database schema structure.

3. **Automated Migration Application**: Flyway can automatically apply pending migrations when our application starts, ensuring the database is always up-to-date.

4. **Repeatable Migrations**: It supports repeatable migrations, which are useful for things like updating views or stored procedures.

5. **Integration with Ktor**: Flyway can be easily integrated into our Ktor application, allowing us to manage migrations as part of our application lifecycle.

## Scenarios Where Flyway Shines

### Scenario 1: Adding a New Column

Without Flyway:
- Manually add the column to the production database
- Remember to add it to staging and development databases
- Risk of forgetting the change in some environments

With Flyway:
- Create a migration script: `V2__Add_category_to_quotes.sql`
- The script is automatically applied to all environments
- The change is versioned and tracked

### Scenario 2: Renaming a Column

Without Flyway:
- Manually rename the column in each environment
- Update all queries in the codebase
- Risk of missing some instances or environments

With Flyway:
- Create a migration script: `V3__Rename_author_to_creator.sql`
- The script handles the renaming across all environments
- Can include data migration if needed

### Scenario 3: Data Migration

Without Flyway:
- Write a script to migrate data
- Manually run the script in each environment
- No clear record of when or if the migration was run

With Flyway:
- Create a migration script: `V4__Migrate_user_roles.sql`
- The script is run automatically and only once
- Clear record of the migration in Flyway's schema history table

## Implementation in Our Ktor Project

To implement Flyway in our Ktor project:

1. Add Flyway dependency to `build.gradle.kts`:
   ```kotlin
   implementation("org.flywaydb:flyway-core:9.16.0")
   ```

2. Create a `resources/db/migration` directory for migration scripts.

3. Name migration scripts following Flyway's naming convention:
   - `V1__Create_quotes_table.sql`
   - `V2__Add_category_to_quotes.sql`

4. Initialize Flyway in our `DatabaseConfig.kt`:
   ```kotlin
   import org.flywaydb.core.Flyway

   object DatabaseConfig {
       fun init(jdbcUrl: String, username: String, password: String) {
           // Existing database connection code...

           val flyway = Flyway.configure()
               .dataSource(jdbcUrl, username, password)
               .load()
           flyway.migrate()

           // Rest of the initialization...
       }
   }
   ```

By implementing Flyway, we ensure that our database schema evolves alongside our application code, making it easier to manage changes, collaborate with team members, and maintain consistency across different environments.
